    passage: `
Maya loved exploring the garden behind her house.

One Saturday morning, she noticed a wooden ladder hidden behind some bushes.

She carefully moved the leaves and found a small treehouse high in an old mango tree.

Inside the treehouse was a wooden box.

Maya opened the box and found a notebook, a magnifying glass, and a small compass.

The notebook belonged to her grandfather when he was a child.

It contained drawings of birds, insects, and plants from the garden.

Maya decided to continue her grandfather's work.

She spent the afternoon observing butterflies and writing notes in the notebook.

Before sunset, she discovered a rare blue butterfly sitting on a flower.

Maya drew a picture of it carefully.

She learned that exploring nature required patience and careful observation.

A little cloud floated high above a village.

The cloud was smaller than all the other clouds.

One morning, the wind carried the little cloud toward a dry field.

The little cloud wanted to help, but it did not have much water.

    passage: `
Arun and his sister Meera built small boats from paper.

They wanted to race them in a shallow stream near their house.

Arun made his boat very wide.

Meera made hers narrow and long.

When they placed the boats in the water, Arun's boat moved slowly.

Meera's boat moved quickly with the current.

Arun wondered why.

Their father explained that the shape and weight of a boat can affect how it moves.

Arun changed his design and made the bottom flatter.

They tested the new boat several times.

Eventually, Arun's boat moved more smoothly.

The children learned that testing and changing an idea can help solve a problem.

    passage: `
Omar received a bright yellow kite for his birthday.

He took it to the park on a windy afternoon.

The kite rose higher and higher.

Suddenly, the string slipped from Omar's hand.

The kite flew over a fence and landed in a tall tree.

Omar felt disappointed.

He did not climb the tree because it was unsafe.

Instead, he asked a park worker for help.

The worker used a long pole to gently bring the kite down.

Omar thanked him.

He tied the string more securely before flying the kite again.

Omar learned that staying safe is more important than rushing to solve a problem.

Every Monday, the students watered the school garden.

One morning, they noticed that several sunflower leaves had small holes.

The children wondered what had happened.

Their teacher asked them to observe the plants carefully.

They found tiny green caterpillars underneath the leaves.

The teacher explained that caterpillars sometimes eat plant leaves.

Instead of harming them, the class moved the caterpillars to a different area with wild plants.

A few weeks later, the children saw butterflies near the garden.

They wondered if the caterpillars had changed into butterflies.

The teacher explained that caterpillars go through a life cycle before becoming butterflies.

The children were excited to learn from their garden.

When she returned, the other bees were organizing food inside the hive.

Bina helped place the nectar in the correct area.

The queen bee did not do all the work alone.

Every bee had a different job.

Bina learned that a community works well when everyone contributes.

In a dry desert, a small flower grew between two rocks.

The days were hot, and rain was rare.

The flower had deep roots that reached water below the ground.

    passage: `
Sara visited a history museum with her class.

She saw old tools, clothes, coins, and maps.

One display showed how people traveled long ago.

There were wooden carts and old boats.

Sara noticed that the tools looked very different from the tools people use today.

Her teacher explained that people invent new tools to make work easier.

Sara wrote three interesting facts in her notebook.

Before leaving, she looked at a large map showing ancient trade routes.

She wondered how people could travel such long distances without airplanes.

Sara learned that studying the past can help us understand how life has changed.

    passage: `
Kiran's class planned a visit to a nature park.

Their teacher gave each group a simple map.

The map showed paths, a pond, a picnic area, and an observation tower.

Kiran's group wanted to reach the tower.

They followed the path on the map.

At one point, they saw two paths.

Kiran checked the map carefully.

The correct path went beside the pond.

They followed it and soon reached the tower.

From the top, they could see trees and a small lake.

Kiran learned that maps help people understand where places are and how to reach them.

    passage: `
On a sunny day, Noor noticed her shadow following her.

When she walked, it walked.

When she stopped, it stopped.

Noor wondered why the shadow changed size.

Her father explained that shadows are made when an object blocks light.

At noon, Noor noticed that her shadow was short.

Later in the afternoon, it became longer.

She moved around the garden and watched the shadow change.

Noor learned that the position of the Sun affects the size and direction of a shadow.

Every Saturday morning, Farah visited the local market with her mother.

Farmers brought vegetables, fruits, and fresh herbs.

One farmer showed Farah a basket of carrots.

Some carrots were large, while others were small.

Farah asked why they were different sizes.

The farmer explained that plants do not always grow at exactly the same rate.

Farah noticed that the vegetables were arranged carefully.

Some sellers used scales to measure their produce.

Farah helped her mother choose vegetables.

She learned that markets bring together farmers, sellers, and families.

    passage: `
One Saturday morning, Mia was helping her grandmother clean the garden. 
While moving some dry leaves near an old rose bush, she noticed something 
blue behind the plants.

Mia moved the leaves carefully and found a tiny blue door. It was so small 
that an adult could not fit through it. There was a golden handle in the 
middle of the door and a tiny key hanging beside it.

Mia looked around before picking up the key. She put it into the lock and 
turned it slowly. Click! The little door opened.

Behind the door was a narrow path covered with sparkling golden leaves. 
Mia followed the path and soon reached a garden that she had never seen 
before. The flowers were taller than she was, and tiny butterflies flew 
around them.

Suddenly, Mia heard a soft voice.

"Please help me!"

She looked around and saw a small purple flower bending toward the ground. 
The flower explained that a silver seed had disappeared from the garden. 
Without the seed, the garden would lose its special glow.

Mia searched under the leaves, beside the pond, and near the tall trees. 
She finally noticed a trail of tiny silver marks leading toward a bush.

Behind the bush, she found the silver seed. A little squirrel had carried 
it there because it thought the seed was a shiny nut.

Mia returned the seed to the flower. The entire garden began to sparkle.

"Thank you," said the flower.

When Mia returned through the blue door, only a few minutes had passed. 
Her grandmother was still watering the roses.

Mia smiled and quietly looked at the old rose bush. She wondered if the 
secret garden would still be there the next day.

    passage: `
Riya loved her red lunchbox. It had a picture of a yellow butterfly on 
the lid, and her father had given it to her on her first day of school.

One Monday morning, Riya placed her lunchbox inside her school bag. 
During the lunch break, she opened her bag, but the lunchbox was gone.

Riya became worried.

She looked under her desk first. It was not there. Then she checked 
the classroom shelf, but she found only books and pencils.

"I remember putting it in my bag," she thought.

Riya did not blame anyone. Instead, she decided to look carefully for clues.

Near her desk, she noticed three tiny rice grains on the floor. She 
followed them toward the classroom door. Another few grains were near 
the water station.

Riya continued looking. The trail ended near the playground.

There she saw her friend Tara sitting beside a bench. Tara was holding 
a red lunchbox.

Riya's eyes became wide.

Before she could say anything, Tara stood up.

"Riya! I found this lunchbox near the playground. I thought someone had 
lost it, so I was going to take it to the teacher."

Riya looked closely. It was her lunchbox.

She remembered that she had taken her lunchbox outside earlier that 
morning when her teacher asked the children to eat some fruit in the 
fresh air. She had forgotten to bring it back.

"Thank you for finding it," Riya said.

Tara smiled.

Riya learned something important that day. When something goes missing, 
it is better to look for facts and clues than to quickly blame another 
person.

The next day, Riya put a bright name sticker on her lunchbox.

    passage: `
High above the Earth lived a small white cloud named Puffy. Puffy had 
many cloud friends who traveled across the sky together.

One afternoon, a strong wind suddenly blew across the sky.

Whoosh!

Puffy was pushed far away from the other clouds.

When the wind finally stopped, Puffy looked around. The sky was empty.

"I am lost," Puffy said sadly.

Puffy floated over a tall mountain. Below, he saw trees and a small 
village. The people were carrying empty buckets because their wells 
had almost no water.

Puffy wanted to help, but he was only a little cloud.

He gathered the tiny drops of water inside himself. Then he released 
them slowly.

Drip.

Drop.

Soon, a gentle rain began to fall.

The villagers smiled and collected the water.

Puffy felt happy, but he still did not know where his cloud family was.

He floated farther and reached a large garden. The flowers were dry, 
and their leaves were bending toward the ground.

Puffy gave them some rain too.

As he continued traveling, he noticed something bright below him. 
Thousands of flowers had opened after the rain. Their colors formed a 
long line across the land.

Puffy followed the colorful line.

At the end of it, he saw a group of clouds.

"Puffy!" they called.

Puffy had finally found his family.

He told them about the village and the thirsty garden.

His cloud friends were proud of him.

Puffy realized that getting lost had helped him discover something 
important: even a small cloud can make a big difference.

    passage: `
Kabir loved walking through the forest near his house. He enjoyed 
listening to birds, watching butterflies, and collecting interesting 
leaves.

One morning, while sitting under a very old tree, Kabir heard a strange 
sound.

"Help..."

Kabir looked around.

Nobody was there.

He listened again.

"Please help..."

This time he realized that the sound was coming from the tree.

Kabir was surprised. He placed his hand on the tree trunk.

"What happened?" he asked.

The tree told him that a family of birds had built a nest on one of 
its branches. During the night, a strong storm had blown the nest down. 
Three baby birds were now hiding beneath some leaves.

Kabir carefully searched the ground.

After a few minutes, he found the baby birds. They were cold and 
frightened.

Kabir did not touch them. Instead, he called his mother, who knew how 
to safely help birds.

Together, they placed the nest in a safe low branch and waited nearby.

The mother bird returned soon.

She flew around the nest and called loudly to her babies.

The baby birds answered.

Kabir smiled.

Before leaving, he placed his hand on the old tree again.

"Thank you for telling me," he whispered.

The tree made a soft rustling sound.

Kabir knew that he might never hear a tree speak again. But from that 
day forward, he paid closer attention to the sounds of nature.

He learned that the forest had many messages, even when people were 
too busy to notice them.

    passage: `
Lina was cleaning an old drawer when she found a strange silver pencil.

It looked ordinary, but a tiny star was carved into its side.

Lina took a piece of paper and drew a red butterfly.

To her surprise, the butterfly moved.

Lina jumped back.

The butterfly flew around the room for exactly ten minutes before 
turning back into a drawing.

Lina tested the pencil again. She drew a small blue bird, and the bird 
flapped its wings. She drew a green apple, and the apple rolled across 
the table.

Lina became excited.

Then she had an idea.

She drew a bicycle.

The bicycle suddenly appeared beside her.

Lina rode it around the garden. She was having fun when she noticed 
her little brother standing near the gate.

"Can you draw me a boat?" he asked.

Lina drew a beautiful boat.

The boat became real.

But then Lina made a mistake.

She drew a huge black cloud because she wanted to see what would happen.

The cloud appeared above the house.

Thunder began to rumble.

Rain poured down.

Lina quickly remembered that everything she drew lasted only ten minutes.

She waited.

After ten minutes, the cloud disappeared.

The sun came out again.

Lina looked at the pencil carefully.

She understood that having a magical tool was exciting, but using it 
without thinking could cause problems.

From that day, Lina used the pencil only when she had a good reason.

    passage: `
Piko was a young penguin who lived with his family near a cold blue sea.

One morning, Piko followed a group of penguins toward the water. He 
was busy watching a shiny fish when a strong wave pushed him away from 
the group.

When Piko looked up, his family was gone.

He felt frightened.

Piko decided not to panic. He remembered something his father had 
told him: "When you are lost, stop, look, and think."

Piko stopped near a large rock.

First, he looked around. He saw a group of seals resting on the ice.

"Have you seen my family?" he asked.

One seal pointed toward the far side of the sea.

Piko thanked the seal and continued.

Soon he met a large seabird.

The seabird told Piko that it had seen many penguins moving toward a 
tall iceberg.

Piko followed the direction.

When he reached the iceberg, he heard familiar sounds.

"Peep! Peep!"

It was his little sister.

Piko hurried toward the sound.

His family had been looking for him too.

His mother hugged him with her wings.

Piko told them how he had stopped, looked carefully, and asked the 
animals for help.

His father smiled.

"You remembered what I taught you."

Piko was happy to be home.

From that day on, he stayed closer to his family whenever they traveled.

    passage: `
One rainy afternoon, Daniel and his classmates were cleaning an old 
storage room at school.

Behind a broken cupboard, Daniel noticed a small wooden box.

The box had a picture of a star on its lid.

"Maybe it is treasure!" Daniel said.

Their teacher carefully opened the box.

Inside was an old piece of paper with a drawing of the school building. 
There was a red X near the library.

The teacher smiled.

"It looks like a treasure hunt."

The children followed the first clue to the library. Behind a large 
dictionary, they found another note.

It said:

"Go where stories sleep, but look below."

The children looked at the bookshelves. Then Maya noticed a small 
wooden drawer underneath the lowest shelf.

Inside the drawer was another clue.

The next clue took them to the school garden. Near a large tree, they 
found a stone with a star carved into it.

Daniel moved the stone carefully.

Under it was a small metal box.

Everyone became excited.

The teacher opened the box.

Inside were old photographs of the school, a tiny golden medal, and a 
letter written by the school's first teacher many years ago.

The letter explained that the medal was given to the first student 
who helped build the school garden.

The children realized that the treasure was not valuable because it 
was made of gold. It was valuable because it told the story of their 
school.

Their teacher placed everything safely in the school museum.

Daniel smiled.

The treasure hunt had helped them discover a part of their school's past.

    passage: `
Anju loved planting vegetables with her grandfather.

One afternoon, her grandfather gave her three tiny seeds.

"Plant them carefully," he said. "Then remember to give them just 
enough water."

Anju planted the seeds in three rows.

The next morning, something strange had happened.

A giant carrot had grown in the first row.

It was almost as tall as Anju.

In the second row was a huge pumpkin. It was so wide that Anju could 
not put her arms around it.

The third row had an enormous tomato.

Anju called her grandfather.

They looked at the vegetables carefully.

"We need to understand why they are growing so quickly," Grandpa said.

Anju noticed that the soil around the plants was sparkling.

She also saw tiny blue stones near the roots. 

Grandpa explained that these tiny stones are fertilizers which makes the plants to grow quickly.

Anju wanted to keep the giant vegetables, but the pumpkin was growing 
toward the garden fence and could soon damage it.

She and Grandpa decided to move the plant carefully.

They used a wooden board to support the pumpkin and gently guided its 
vine away from the fence.

The next day, the vegetables stopped growing.

Anju and Grandpa harvested them.

The giant carrot made enough soup for many people. The pumpkin was used 
to make several pies, and the tomato was shared with the neighbors.

Anju learned that growing food was not only about planting seeds. 
Plants needed care, attention, and sometimes a little help from people.

    passage: `
Bolt was a small robot built to help children at a science museum.

He could answer questions, count objects, find missing things, and even 
solve simple puzzles.

But Bolt had one problem.

He did not understand friendship.

One morning, a boy named Sam dropped his box of colored blocks.

The blocks rolled everywhere.

Bolt quickly calculated where each block had stopped.

"Red block: three meters away. Blue block: two meters away," he said.

Sam looked at him.

"Can you help me pick them up?"

"I have already told you where they are," Bolt replied.

Sam looked disappointed.

Later that day, Sam sat alone near a model rocket.

Bolt noticed that Sam was quiet.

His computer could not understand why.

He asked, "Are you sad?"

Sam nodded.

"My friends are playing outside. I wanted to build the rocket with 
them, but they left without me."

Bolt thought carefully.

He remembered something from the museum's books: friends help one another.

Bolt brought the colored blocks to Sam.

"Would you like to build something together?" he asked.

Sam smiled.

They built a colorful rocket using the blocks.

When the other children returned, they were amazed.

"Can we build one too?" they asked.

Sam nodded.

Soon everyone was working together.

Bolt watched them.

He finally understood that helping someone was not only about finding 
answers or solving problems. Sometimes, helping meant listening, sharing, 
and staying beside someone who felt lonely.

From that day, Bolt became more than a robot in the museum.

He became a friend.

    passage: `
Every morning, Emma walked past the playground on her way to school.

One Tuesday morning, she noticed a line of tiny footprints in the 
sand.

They began near the school gate and ended beside a large bush.

Emma stopped.

The footprints were strange.

They were smaller than a dog's footprints but larger than a bird's.

Emma followed them carefully.

Behind the bush, she found a broken flowerpot.

Next to it was a small green leaf.

Emma picked up the leaf and looked around.

Suddenly, she heard a soft sound.

"Meow."

A kitten stepped out from behind the bush.

Emma smiled.

The kitten had a tiny muddy paw.

She understood that the footprints belonged to the kitten.

But why was the kitten hiding there?

Emma noticed that the kitten kept looking toward the school kitchen.

She followed the kitten from a safe distance.

Near the kitchen door, a school worker was carrying a box of vegetables.

A carrot fell from the box.

The kitten quickly ran toward it.

Emma realized that the kitten was hungry.

She told the school worker about the kitten.

The worker placed some water in a bowl and contacted an animal rescue 
group.

The kitten was safely taken to a shelter.

A few days later, Emma saw a photograph of the kitten on the shelter's 
notice board.

It had been adopted by a family.

Emma smiled when she saw the picture.

The mysterious footprints had led her to a small animal that needed help.

    passage: `
A school near the desert organized a special treasure hunt for the 
children.

Three friends, Sara, Omar, and Leo, decided to take part.

Their teacher gave them a map and explained the rules.

"The treasure is hidden somewhere along the safe walking path. You must 
follow the clues and stay together."

The first clue said:

"Find the place where three tall rocks stand like towers."

The children walked carefully across the sandy path.

After a few minutes, they found three tall rocks.

Behind the middle rock was another clue.

It said:

"Look for the shadow that points toward the morning sun."

The children looked around.

Leo noticed a long shadow from a palm tree.

They followed the direction of the shadow and found a small wooden sign.

The sign had a picture of a camel.

They walked toward the camel sign and discovered a small box.

Inside the box was a final clue.

It said:

"The treasure is close, but do not look where everyone is looking."

The children looked at the ground.

Nothing.

They looked behind the sign.

Nothing.

Then Sara noticed that the teacher had told them to stay on the safe 
walking path.

She looked carefully at the path.

One stone was shaped differently from all the others.

Sara moved the stone.

Underneath it was a small golden box.

The children cheered.

Inside were colorful badges and a note.

The note said, "The real treasure is learning to work together and 
notice things carefully."

The children proudly returned to school.

They discovered that solving the clues was more exciting than the 
prize itself.

One evening, Noah was cleaning his grandfather's old room.

Behind a tall bookshelf, he noticed a small wooden door.

The door had no handle.

Noah touched it.

Suddenly, the door opened.

On the other side was a bright room filled with clocks.

A large clock stood in the middle.

A note on the clock said:

Noah was curious.

He looked through the doorway.

He saw his school.

The playground was covered with paper and plastic.

Children were walking around the rubbish.

Noah felt worried.

He stepped back.

The door closed.

The next morning, Noah looked around his classroom.

There was a lot of paper near the recycling box.

During lunch, he noticed several empty bottles on the playground.

Noah remembered what he had seen through the mysterious door.

Instead of telling everyone that the future would definitely become 
messy, he spoke to his teacher.

"Can we make our school cleaner?" he asked.

The teacher agreed.

Noah and his classmates made signs reminding students to use recycling 
bins.

They also organized a clean-up activity.

By the end of the day, the playground was clean.

Noah returned home and opened the old door again.

This time, he looked through it.

The playground was green and clean.

Children were playing happily.

Noah smiled.

He understood that the door had not shown a fixed future.

It had shown one possible future.

The choices people made could change what happened next.
